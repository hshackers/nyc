> Hey everyone, happy to confirm that we've got everything set for you to come to Stack. I've invited a few developers that work here and some awesome entrepreneurs heavily involved in the startup scene in New York to come meet you. It's going to be a great event, and an awesome time to show off your work. Looking forward to meeting you all.
